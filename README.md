Project Objectives:
The aim of this project is to design and implement a relational database to efficiently manage employee records, including personal details, job positions, departments, and salaries. This project focuses on creating complex relationships between entities and writing SQL queries to perform various operations like managing employee information, retrieving departmental data, and generating salary reports.

By the end of the project, you will:

Create a well-structured database that captures all necessary details about employees, job positions, and departments.
Write SQL queries to manage and manipulate employee and departmental data.
Implement SQL joins to combine information from different tables and generate comprehensive reports.
Perform data operations like updating, deleting, and retrieving records using complex queries.
Key Activities:
Database Schema Design: Design and implement tables for Employees, Departments, and Job Positions with appropriate relationships (primary keys, foreign keys, constraints).

Data Insertion and Management:

Insert records into the database for employees, departments, and job positions.
Write SQL queries to manage employee records, such as updating personal details, job positions, and salaries.
Complex Queries and Joins:

Write SQL queries that use JOIN operations to combine employee data with their job positions and departments.
Implement queries to retrieve specific data, such as employees in a certain department or those with a particular job position.
Data Retrieval and Reports:

Create reports that show employee details along with their department and salary.
Retrieve records based on various filters (e.g., all employees in a department, employees earning above a certain salary).
Technologies Used:
SQL (Structured Query Language): Used to create and manage the database, write queries, and perform joins across tables.
Database Management System (DBMS): MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store and retrieve data efficiently.
VS Code with SQL Tools Extension: A code editor to write and execute SQL queries.

Steps to Get the Output:
Set Up the Environment:

Install a DBMS such as MySQL or PostgreSQL on your system.
Use a database management tool like MySQL Workbench or VS Code with the SQL Tools extension to write and run SQL queries.
Create the Database and Tables:

Define the structure of the database by creating tables for Employees, Departments, and Job Positions. The tables will include primary and foreign keys to ensure referential integrity between related records.

Insert Data into Tables:

Add sample data to the tables using INSERT queries. This includes employee personal details, job positions, and department assignments.

Implement Joins and Complex Queries:

Use JOIN queries to combine data from multiple tables and generate reports. For example, retrieving all employees from a particular department:

Update and Manage Data:

Write UPDATE queries to modify employee information, such as adjusting salaries or changing job positions.

Generate Reports and Summarize Data:

Retrieve specific reports such as the average salary by department or the total number of employees in each department:

Test and Validate:

Test your SQL queries by running them in the DBMS or the SQL Tools extension in VS Code. Ensure that the queries return the expected results and that the relationships between tables are working as intended.

Conclusion:
This project provides practical experience in designing and managing relational databases for employee records. By following the steps outlined above, you will create a system that efficiently handles employee information, job positions, and departmental details. Through the use of SQL queries, you will be able to retrieve and manipulate complex data while ensuring the integrity of the relationships between different entities in the database.

Write SQL Queries for Data Management:

Write SQL queries to perform data retrieval, updates, and deletions. For example, retrieving a list of all employees along with their department and job position:
